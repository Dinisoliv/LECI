IPV6

1. There are two types of packets shown, ICMPv6(IPv6) and MDNS.
First, there is a solicitation from the VM to the Switch for a specific IPv6 address. Then, the Switch "flushes" that IPv6 address, shown through MDNS packets.
The Switch attempts to communicate with a Router (through Router Solicitation), but since there is no Router connected, nothing happens.

And some multicast listeners report message are detected from time to time.

2. Since there is a router to communicate, we get Router Advertisements and CDP packets, that show where the Router is connected and that there is connection between the VM and the Router

3. The global IPv6 address is defined with the given command for the network in the specified interface. So the VM sends out a neighbor solicitation (asking for the given address and checking duplicates). And then after IP configuration, it sends out an advertisement, confirming it had been configured with the IP.

4. With a given pc MAC address, the EUI-64 method, the mac address it's splited in 2 and added 'fffe' in middle and the 7 MSbit is inverted.
For example: CA-01-3A-D0-00-1C -> 8A01:3AFF:FE00:1C
Even though its simple, it may generate a safety problem because if someone can access the network, it's going to be easy to calculate/find addresses.
The process of obtaining a IPv6 address does not change if done by the same MAC address, since the process is the exact same, hence why it's not very secure to use.

5. Through neighbor solicitation from the pc and neighbor advertisement its discovered the mac address and after that communication and packet exchange is enabled.
